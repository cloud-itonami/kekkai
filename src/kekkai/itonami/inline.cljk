  "Compile-time resource inlining for the Worker build.

  `jp-go-dds.page/page` takes the stylesheet as a string so it can stay a pure
  function; on the JVM the caller slurps it. A Worker has no filesystem, and the
  stylesheet lives in a git dependency rather than in this repository, so it is
  read from the classpath while shadow-cljs compiles and shipped as a literal.
  One source of truth, one copy in the bundle, no vendored duplicate to drift
  the next time jp-go-dds is bumped."

  `blueprint.edn` lives at the repository root because that is where every
  other cloud-itonami blueprint lives and where tooling looks for it. Copying
  it under `resources/` to make it classpath-visible would create a second
  blueprint that is authoritative for the Worker and stale everywhere else, so
  the one copy is read from where it belongs. Same compile-time failure: a
  missing blueprint is a build error, not an endpoint that quietly serves
  nothing."
