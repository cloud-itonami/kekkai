  "The x402 payment gate, in the thin mode: this seller keeps its own gate and
  delegates on-chain verification to the facilitator.

  `pay.x402` builds the challenge, so seller and facilitator agree by sharing a
  codec rather than by two readings of one specification. Nothing here holds a
  key — `X402_PAY_TO` is a public treasury address, and settlement is the
  facilitator's business.

  ## The gate fails closed, including when the facilitator is down

  A verifier that cannot reach `/verify` knows nothing about the payment, and
  'unknown' is not 'paid'. Answering 402 when the facilitator is unreachable
  costs a paying caller a retry; answering 200 costs the seller the resource,
  and does so precisely when something is already wrong. The distinction is
  reported (`:facilitator-unreachable` rather than `:payment-invalid`) so a
  caller can tell 'pay again' from 'wait'."
